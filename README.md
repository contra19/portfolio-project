# Rob Wisniewski Portfolio

## A showcase of projects/websites that Rob has created

## Description
Welcome to my showcase! This is where you will be abl;e to find a portfolio of the projects I am currently working on or have worked on in the past. My intent is for this to be a place for mew to display my talents and for others, especially prospective employers/customers, to find samples of my work. 

These works use several technologies and more will be added as I experiment more with others. Currently HTML and CSS are utilized with JavaScript coming in the near future. 

## Usage
There is no installation necessary for this project as you can go directly to https://contra19.github.io/portfolio-project/ to see my portfolio in an interactive way. You can use the page to see my projects and go directly to them. If you have a specific project you want to look at in mind and want to skip going to the page, you will find a list of all the included projects below.

Collaboration credit to my classmates Katelyn Hardigree and NIck Zamboni who provided verbal input for me to verify and adjust my code accordingly as well as provide some
inspiration. Their input helped me to shape the page that is being presented. Links to their profiles will be included here as soon as I am able to get them.
